This example shows a single self-consistent cycle with the He-He+ dimer.
It is most conveniently run through an interactive session in conjunction with
the jupyter notebook (he2_scf.ipynb)

On Midway 2, this looks like

>> sinteractive --exclusive --partition=broadwl --nodes=2 --time=08:00:00

In a separate terminal but the same directory

>> ip=$(/sbin/ip route get 8.8.8.8 | awk ’{print $NF;exit}’)
>> jupyter-notebook --no-browser --ip=${ip}

to launch the jupyter notebook. 

You may also choose to run using the submission queue. 
Submit script for Midway2 is provided in run_he_scf

NOTE: This particular example will NOT converge and exists for illustrative purposes.
